# Stocks Sentiment Analysis on Reddit and News Articles

##### Note: This project is still under development...

## Introduction:
This project aims to find trending stocks on Reddit and news articles and provide sentiment analysis to them.

PostgreSQL database is used to store the sentiment score of tickers over time.

Users will be able to view the trends on a website, that will be created in Django.

Information such as latest stock prices, revenue and description of the ticker's company will be displayed too.

Graphs shown are made using chart.js
