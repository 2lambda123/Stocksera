                Hello! I'm a self-taught programmer.
                This is my first time deploying such as large scale website.
                Please bear with me if there's bugs or errors, I'll try to fix it immediately.
                I made this website to learn more about trading and investment and I thought that it would be beneficial if I share this website.
                What do I get in return? Absolutely nothing! This website is free of charge, open-sourced and would constantly be maintained in the future.
