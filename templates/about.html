                Hello World! I'm a 19 year old self-taught programmer.
                This is my first time deploying such as large scale website.
                Please bear with me if there's bugs or errors, I'll try to fix it immediately.
                Some of you may asked: "Why am I doing this?"
                Well, I started investing and trading in January 2021 - peak of a bull market.
                GME, AMC and other "memes" stocks such as BB and NOK shot up exponentially and making money was a breeze.
                However, in recent months, the rise in inflation fears, resurgence of Covid-19 cases around the world resulted in somewhat a minor market correction for technology stocks and that's when I constantly see myself in the red.
                I started to realise that actual DD is needed and buying stocks based on Reddit and news sentiment might not be a good choice every time.
                As such, I made this website to learn more about trading and investment and I thought that it would be beneficial if I share this website.
                What do I get in return? Absolutely nothing! This website is free of charge, open-sourced and would constantly be maintained in the future.
